-- üåü Exercise 1 : Items And Customers
-- Instructions
-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

-- Update data base
-- CREATE TABLE items (
-- 	item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
-- 	item_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
-- 	item_price INTEGER
-- );

-- CREATE TABLE customers
-- CREATE TABLE customers (
-- 	customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
-- 	first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
-- 	last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
-- );

-- INSERT INTO items(item_name, item_price)
-- VALUES
-- 	('Small Desk', 100),
-- 	('Large desk', 300),
-- 	('Fan', 80)
-- RETURNING * -- ->OK

-- INSERT INTO customers(first_name, last_name)
-- VALUES
-- 	('Greg', 'Jones'),
-- 	('Sandra', 'Jones'),
-- 	('Scott', 'Scott'),
-- 	('Trevor', 'Green'),
-- 	('Melanie', 'Johnson')
-- RETURNING * -- ->OK


-- Use SQL to get the following from the database:
-- All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
-- SELECT item_name, item_price AS price FROM items ORDER BY price ASC

-- Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
-- SELECT item_name, item_price AS price FROM items 
-- WHERE item_price >= 80 
-- ORDER BY 2 DESC 

-- The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) ‚Äì exclude the 
-- primary key column from the results.
-- SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers 
-- ORDER BY first_name ASC
-- LIMIT 3

-- All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)
-- SELECT last_name FROM customers 
-- ORDER BY last_name DESC

-- SELECT film_id, title, description, length, rental_rate FROM film
-- WHERE title ILIKE '%love%'

-- Bonus: Try to not use LIMIT.
-- SELECT film_id, title, rental_rate
-- FROM film 
-- WHERE film_id NOT IN (SELECT film_id FROM film ORDER BY rental_rate ASC FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY)
-- ORDER BY  rental_rate ASC

-- You want to get the first name and last name from the curstomer table, as well as the amount and the date
